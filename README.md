# Introduction
We propose Entropic DLP (EDLP), an entropy-guided,
gradient-based proposal for sampling discrete flat
modes. EDLP efficiently incorporates local entropy
guidance by coupling discrete and continuous variables
within a joint distribution.


# Dependencies
* [PyTorch 1.9.1](http://pytorch.org/) 
* [torchvision 0.10.1](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/)
